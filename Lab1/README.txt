1) I would create a line segment of LED's. I would then connect my switches to the LED through some logic circuits.
This kind of draws back from part B in the lab because I would want it so that every time I flicked a switch, it would result the equivalent amount that 
a digital number display would show. I would label each LED on my line segment to represent a value like A or F and based on my switches, I would be able to
tell what value I have on my line segment by adding up the values represented in the LED's (For numbers) or just looking at the LED's (For Letter based values).


2)  I don't believe things can really fully be random in a computer. 
To create one, I believe you'd need to first create a formula with sets of logic gates attached to each other.
Each set cannot be repeated again as they all must be different. No one should be able to predict what number will show
unless they know this secret formula. Also, we would need to input a "seed" value into our random number generator so it can produce
different results each time. So a combination of random seeds inputted by the user and non repeating logic gate sets should make 
a more likely random, random number generator but not a perfect one. You'd probably have to start measuring natural elements located 
in the Earth like radioactive material decay for something to be truly random.
